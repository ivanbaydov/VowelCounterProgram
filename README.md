# VowelCounterProgram
In this program the user will enter there file and it will count up all the vowels from A,E,I,O and U. It will also count 3 Diffrent letterts B,C and D.
It will then display the output of each diffrent vowel or letter that was found. When displaying the total vowel count we dont add the 3 Diffrent letters that are B, C and D since they are not vowels.
